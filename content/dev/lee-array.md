### 134.Gas Station
> There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
Note:
If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.  
Example 1:
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3  
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        '''
        time limited exceed...
        '''
        for count, i in enumerate(gas):
            tank = i
            if(tank - cost[count])<0:
                continue
            round = 0
            ini = count
            while tank >= 0:
                if count == len(gas)-1:
                    k = 0
                else: k = count+1
                if tank - cost[count] < 0:
                    break
                tank = tank - cost[count] + gas[k]
                round += 1
                if count == len(gas) -1:
                    count = 0
                else: count += 1
                if round == len(gas) :
                    return ini
        return -1

    def canCompleteCircuit2(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        tmp = [x - y for x, y in zip(gas, cost)]
        print(tmp+tmp)
        cur = 0
        ans = 0
        for i, val in enumerate(tmp + tmp):
            cur += val
            if cur < 0:
                ans = i + 1
                if ans >= len(gas):
                    return -1
                cur = 0
        return ans

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # gas  = [4,5,3,1,4]
    # cost = [5,4,3,4,2]

    gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
    cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
    # gas  = [3,3,4]
    # cost = [3,4,4]
    s = Solution()
    ans = s.canCompleteCircuit2(gas, cost)
    print(ans)

### 299.Bulls and cows
> Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"  
Output: "1A3B"  
Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
Iterate over the secret string, store all the bulls in an array and keep track of the count for each character that isn't a bull in another array
Iterate over guess string, if the character isn't a bull, then remove the count of that character and increment cows
```python
import collections

class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:
        bulls = cows = 0
        d = collections.defaultdict(int)
        for i, c in enumerate(secret):
            if c == guess[i]:
                bulls += 1
            else:
                d[c] += 1
        for i, c in enumerate(guess):
            if c != secret[i] and c in d and d[c] > 0:
                cows += 1
                d[c] -= 1
        return str(bulls) + "A" + str(cows) + "B"

```
### 41.First Missing Positive

> Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.  
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3  
Example 2:
Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```python
from typing import List
import sys

class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums):
        i = 0
        while (i<len(nums)): 
            if nums[i]<=0: nums.pop(i)
            else: i+=1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            index = nums[i]-1
            if index<len(nums) and nums[index]>0: nums[index] *= -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]>0: return i+1
        return len(nums)+1

    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            while 1 <= nums[i] <= len(nums) and nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]:
                nums[nums[i] - 1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != i + 1:
                return i + 1
        return len(nums) + 1
```
### 561.Array Partition I
> Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.  
Example 1:
Input: [1,4,3,2]
Output: 4  
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```python
class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        total = 0   
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(nums)-1, 2):
            total += nums[i]
        return total


if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Solution()
    ans = s.arrayPairSum([1,2,3,4])
    print(ans)
```


### 189.Rotate Array
> Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.  
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]  
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

```python
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:

        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
       
    def rotate2(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        for _ in range(k):
            nums.insert(0,nums.pop())

        # other:
        #  k = k % len(nums)
        #  nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]

        # nums.reverse()
        # k = k % len(nums)  
        # nums[:k]=nums[:k][::-1] # [7,6,5] -> [5,6,7]
        # nums[k:]=nums[k:][::-1] #[4,3,2,1] -> [1,2,3,4]
```

### 80.Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

> Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.  
Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        i = 0
        for n in nums:
            if i < 2 or n > nums[i-2]:
                nums[i] = n
                i += 1
        return i
```

### 26.Remove Duplicate 

> Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.  
Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

```python
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0 
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 1
        for count, i in enumerate(nums):
            j = count+1
            if j == len(nums):
                print(nums)
                return len(nums)
            while i == nums[j]:
                nums.remove(i)
                # j = j+1
                if j == len(nums):
                    print(nums)
                    return len(nums)
        return len(nums)
    def removeDuplicates2(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[left]:
                left+=1
                nums[left] = nums[i]
        return left + 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Solution()
    nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
    a = s.removeDuplicates(nums)
    print('hhhhh'+str(a))
```

### 27.Remove element
    
> Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.  
Example 1:
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

```python
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        k = 0
        for count, i in enumerate(nums):
            if i == val:
                continue
            else:
                nums[k] = nums[count] 
                k = k+1
        return k
                

class Solution2:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        while (1):
            try:
                nums.remove(val)
            except:
                return len (nums)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Solution2()
    ans = s.removeElement([1,2,2,3,4],2)
    print(ans)
```
