JDBC at first and JPA later.
## 3.1 Reading and writing data with JDBC
Spring JDBC support is rooted in the JdbcTemplate class. JdbcTemplate provides a means by which developers can perform SQL operations against a relational database without all the ceremony and boilerplate typically required when working with JDBC.

## Summary
- Springâ€™s JdbcTemplate greatly simplifies working with JDBC. 
- PreparedStatementCreator and KeyHolder can be used together when you need to know the value of a database-generated ID.
- For easy execution of data inserts, use SimpleJdbcInsert. 
- Spring Data JPA makes JPA persistence as easy as writing a repository interface.
