### Intro
DP is a style of coding where you store the results of your algorithm in a data structure while it runs. 

The same subproblem may reoccur compared to divide-and-conquer, a key to solve is to break the problem into **subproblems** such that
1. the original problem can be solved relatively easily once solutions to the subproblems are available
2. these subproblem solutions are **cached**,  caching the results of intermediate computations  

e.g. fibonacci  
code0  O(n) time and O(n) space
```py
def fibonacci(n, cache={}):
	if n <= 1:
		return n
	elif n not in cache:
		cache[n] = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
	return cache[n]
```
code1  O(n) time and O(1) space
```py
def fibonacci(n):
	if n <= 1:
		return n
	fmin2, fmin1 = 0, 1
	for _ in range(1, n):
		f = fmin2 + fmin1
		fmin2, fmin1 = fmin1, f
	return fmin1
```
### [53 Maximum subarray](https://yanjiyu.com/leetcode/53-maximum-subarray/)
> Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
Example:
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4], Output: 6 Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6
```py
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        curSum = res = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            curSum = max(curSum+nums[i], nums[i])
            res = max(res, curSum)
        return res

### [198 House Robber](https://yanjiyu.com/leetcode/198-house-robber/)
> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.  
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,1] Output: 4   
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).   Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

### [55. Jump Game](https://yanjiyu.com/leetcode/55-jump-game/)
> Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Determine if you are able to reach the last index.  
Example 1:
Input: [2,3,1,1,4] Output: true Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.   
Example 2:
Input: [3,2,1,0,4] Output: false Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum   jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        need_step = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)-2, -1, -1):

### [62 Unique Paths](https://yanjiyu.com/leetcode/62-unique-paths/)
> A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?  
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3  
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
> 1. Right -> Right -> Down
> 2. Right -> Down -> Right
> 3. Down -> Right -> Right

### [322. Coin Change](https://yanjiyu.com/leetcode/322-coin-change/)
> You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.  
Example 1:
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1  
Example 2:
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3 Output: -1

F(S)=F(Sâˆ’C)+1, S is the amount, C is the denomination(value of each coin)
```py
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] + amount*[amount+1]  # amount + 1 is the same as infinite big here
        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(coin, amount+1):
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-coin]+1)
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] <= amount else -1

[300 Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://yanjiyu.com/leetcode/300-longest-increasing-subsequence/)

> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence. A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].  
Example:  
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18] Output: 4 Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```py
class Solution: 
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        L = [nums[0]]
        
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > L[-1]:
                L.append(nums[i])
            else:
                # binary search to find the smallest number which is bigger than nums[i]                  
                left = bisect.bisect_left(L, nums[i])
 
                L[left] = nums[i]
      # actuaclly 2,3,7,18
        return len(L)
```
### [279. Perfect squares](https://yanjiyu.com/leetcode/279/)
> Given an integer n, return __the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to__ n.
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.   
Example 1:
Input: n = 12 Output: 3 Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.   
Example 2:
Input: n = 13 Output: 2 Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```py
class Solution(object):
    def numSquares(self, n):
        dp = [0] + [float('inf')]*n
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-j*j] for j in range(1, int(i**0.5)+1)) + 1
        return dp[n]

```
