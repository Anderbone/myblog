[Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/invite/oJtu7A) is one of the most helpful tools for me nowadays, no matter code, work notes, daily notes such as training records, prayer list etc. All stuff can be handled within it.

I used to use OneNote when I was in University, everyone knows how powerful it is. The downside is obvious, it's too heavy. I need a better tool to write everything down quickly and jump to everywhere with a keyboard.

It doesn't have any limit on item. We can put pictures in there with markdown syntax, web, file and inner links are smooth, it also supports code highlight recently, a huge boost. To be honest, I can't find shortcoming currently, maybe the dynalist pro is too expensive? Even that can be handled with the help of Autohotkey.

The only two things I need from Pro plan is 'attachment image' and 'custom shortcuts'. Both can be fixed with other tools. 

- For images:On windows I use [Lightscreen](https://lightscreen.com.ar/), On Linux is [Flameshot](https://flameshot.js.org/#/), both can take screenshots, upload pictures and give the link back to your clipboard smoothly, all you need is a shortcut to put it in Dynalist. 
- [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) on windows or  [Autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey) on Linux can handle shortcut, I will write [another post](https://yanjiyu.com/dev/autohotkey) to show the scripts.
