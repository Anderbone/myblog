From a casual chat with a friend, here are my responses to some common topics about faith.

### All religions are good, all about love and peace.

I don't think Branch Davidians is a good religion. They are also trying to pursue their own truth, they may find something that fits them so we need to respect them even though they may kill children if necessary. I don't agree with that.
The Quran itself, although talks a lot about peace and love, justifies violence in so many places. Taliban is not just a radical group within the Islam world, but devout Muslims who want to take their faith and the book of the Quran seriously. Not all Muslims are pro-Taliban, but there are many other movements among fundamental Muslims that hate western and Christianity. Taliban is not the only representative of Orthodox Muslims, however, what they are doing is within mainstream Islam. Taliban's money comes from selling drugs, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan Islam groups etc. Islam theology divides the world into 2 categories, the house of Islam and the house of war.

Another point, the assumption that all religions are towards something higher together, all about love, or there's only one true God behind all religions, makes this assumption itself higher than all religions and actually against most of them, makes itself a belief without a holy book to support it.

### Islam is the spiritual higher form of Christianity. Like Judaism is a primary school, Christian a high school and Muslim a university

From what I heard, Islam actually goes back to many issues we encounter in the old testament. There doesn't seem to be any progress from the teaching of Jesus Christ to Islam. I talked about sin to my Tunisia friend. I don't think if we admit humans are sinful, there's a way towards freedom apart from Jesus.

I do feel interested in Muslims. I believe we talked about Xinjiang camps before. My province Shaanxi is located in the middle of northwest Muslim culture and the central plains of Han Chinese culture, in history there were many huge massacres between two groups in our area. If anything happens, our hometown is gonna be the frontline to paying the debt again. In my opinion, only Muslims and Christians have more chances to survive in a possible huge disaster in such a society realistically.

### Crusades？
It is easy for modern people to dismiss the crusades. Such judgments, however, tell us more about the observer, who is based on uniquely modern (and, therefore, Western) values. If people use war to force others to believe in Christianity, it's obviously against the teaching of Jesus. Another point is, among all history wars, even religious-related wars, there has been so much research and discussion about crusades in the modern era that is interesting in itself. Most people, even in China, don't know much about the most devastating famine in the 1960s or the War between Muslims and communists in the 1970s.

### The meaningless love without action

People like to talk about love. Here in this little town, our pastor delivers nearly outdated food from supermarkets to poor people for years. Nobody wants to do that, even among so-called Christian - it's heavy-duty, and it's definitely a practice of Jesus' love, he also delivers food to those Muslim refugees.

I know a bit about China's modern history and society. People don't have strong natural communities based on religion, but usually only have very weak connections outside of the family. Everyone just needs to be responsible for himself or just family. It's an extremely weak society and can easily be fucked by communists. Among the most difficult times, the Christian church still existed secretly, even though the son may sell his mom and send her to the death penalty, for she spoke bad words towards Mao at home. In those times we know more deeply about what trust and love are.

> “Love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams. Love in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all. Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage. But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some people too, perhaps, a complete science.” Brothers Karamazov

Atheist or secularist associations are extremely vulnerable and have little resistance to stress, either in the natural or social environment. The future of the human community usually depends not on how well you perform at your most prosperous moments, but on how well you resist hardship at your worst.

### Justification of violence and Quran, there are clear teaching for believers to do it.

The violence in the old testament of the Bible, however, is a totally different topic, we all agree how important the context is. Let alone it's extremely clear in the new testament. You shall love your enemies. So there's no group of Christian who can use violence towards ordinary people randomly and claim they are reasonably based on the teaching of Jesus. There may be some extreme groups or people that comprise terrorism acts who claim they are Christian, the point is there's no single verse that justifies it in the new testament reasonably.
