> In the Bible I learn that God values us not for our strength or our brains but simply because He has made us. Who knows, in His eyes, a half-wit may be worth more than a watchmaker. Or - a lieutenant.  The Hiding place

Put simply, I believe the most important thing is the relationship with God and the people around us, not our personal achievements or career.

A career indeed is extremely important, but still, we need to ask ourselves, why in my heart do I feel a career is so important to me? Especially if we don't have peace when we think about it sometimes, at least I did very often! We ask God to give us a good job to flee from our current situation or to pursue the happiness we believe in, but God may ask us to gratefully accept what we have right now, totally rely on him peacefully, and do whatever in his peace.

I once needed a UK-sponsored job desperately and failed. God created a situation to let me only pursue him alone, (this job at first didn't provide sponsorship nor have a good salary), and I knew him more through my experience.

God supplied grace for the present need. How many of our worries belong today? We have faith, food to eat, a bed to sleep in, a job, and keep a good relationship with people around us.

How many of our anxieties are we running ahead of God's supply? I have nothing to worry about if I can change my job, or not, as my career is to help me serve God, not the other way round, and God is with me so I have everything I need to shine wherever I go. I can try things myself, but I need to do it in the peace of God, not "to save myself with my career" as I tend to tell myself.

I still believe that if I have a permanent residency in the UK, I will be a free man some time. It looks so true, but it's also a lie as I'm already free in faith and I need to take it more deeply. In the worst situation, I need to go back to China and get stuck there, or what if there are some extreme political movements or a war? But I need to accept all these possibilities faithfully to feel the peace of God. As it may also be a great opportunity to share gospels.

Last year one of my beloved ladies had a stroke, she lost lots of her abilities, especially her language skills. After the stroke, she initially could only speak very simple English, and some memories are gone as well. She used to speak Spanish, a tribal language, and spent quite a long time learning Mandarin diligently.

What is left with her, is a stronger faith, and those precious memories when she’s translating the Bible and doing the missions. It gave me such a good lesson, what will I leave if there’s such a day for me? Skills and careers are important, but only when they do serve others, in the way Gods want me. There are lots of people who want to learn how to code and earn more money, but only a few want to spread the gospel that sincerely.

I pray God can protect me.
