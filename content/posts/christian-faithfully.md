The faith in action, in our daily life, as Christian is not to believe something we want must be achieved, but to do it faithfully so *we won't blame ourselves nor cheat ourselves*. The key point is to ask ourselves honestly, how can I do things so I won't blame myself, no matter the results. It's not the thing itself or the result that is terrifying, it's not even others' blame that matters, it's our self-blame and fear that cause trouble. Anything in the world won't necessarily cause us to blame ourselves and we have control of it. Whenever I have shame, there's something I can do better or I need to realize. Whenever I do my best honestly within my limit, even though it may not be very good in other's eyes, I know my limit and I'm progressing and I did try my best and there shouldn't be any shame or fear in me either.

There's absolutely nothing to blame for ourselves if we do things faithfully. I ate ice cream for lunch, I won't blame myself and feel happy to share, because there's nothing I could do better when I forgot to bring lunch and I'm gonna remember it better. I waste my time on Twitter again for 2 hours, I feel very shameful and tend to blame myself and want to hide it because I know I should and *can* do better. I need to find ways to handle it faithfully to make sure I won't blame myself this hard next time, so even though we have so many limits and can't do things perfectly and can't pursue everything, but to achieve a zero self-blame state is doable and practical and it's the way to freedom, not to achieve or complete something.

Suppose I deadly want to use Twitter/Reddit, I can set a clock and waste 20 mins a day shamelessly, maybe 10 mins or 0 mins later, depending on my situation and the shame/faith in my heart. I need to face my shame and I can ask for your help like sharing my phone screen time with people etc. 

If you take initiative to go speak to the colleague, the result doesn't matter, to go speak to him again itself is a huge victory. I may not have the courage to do it myself if I were you but I feel it's a way to think about and pray. If you still feel you can not do it after prayer, it's also absolutely fine because we pray and accept we have limits, so there shouldn't be any shame or fear either.

Our self-shame is the real enemy, to hide or run away makes it bigger. To face shame directly honestly and try to figure out what we can do step by step to reduce it, or share it with others or God makes shame a great signal or like a tough friend for us to live towards freedom.
