"It is more that society shouldn't judge other people to certain standards, e.g. Your value does not come from your intellectual ability, because those who are not intellectual will still be gifted elsewhere. "

Jesus judges all human to a standard that no one can ever achieve and claims everyone is sinful and deserves hell without him. The judgement of Jesus is righteous, and most of time the stardards of society is unfair, but I want to somehow build a connection here: because of the looks-like-unfair but ultimate fair judgement of Jesus, we have full of what we need to face any unfairness or judgement in the world without asking others or society to change.

Back to what you said, society shouldn't judge people to certain standards. You mentioned one example shortly, university choose students based mainly on their academic(math?) score, which may not be fair to students who are not good at exams. When we oppose anything, we better propose what's the alternative or what a person should do instead. What we have is usually the best we can achieve for the moment even though you can easily find 10000 faults in it, and it's the people who oppose it, their responisablity to make changes to current system or give specific suggestions to people who are in the system. Incomplete justice is also justice, and a relatively better justice cannot be denied by saying it's incomplete justice. I can't see any unfairness in this basic logic: group choose member based on certain standards which only suits certain people. A computer science degree needs math background otherwise one may not understand much in class. If a person is good at piano, I don't think a music university requires a high math score. One step further, you don't have to follow the current social standard (university system here), many people may agree that the current education system is meaningless or unfair to them, and they are free to quit and make a life without degrees.

One step further, for sure there's unfair standards in society and people almost have no way else to choose. In mordern China, there's a time when people are not chosen by academic score or exams, but purely by family. My father is a poor farmer then I'm good and may have oppotunity to join a school, his grandfather was a landlord so he's bad and may end up in camps. ([红五类Five red categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Red_Categories)，[黑五类Five black categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Black_Categories)). School, job, army, party, everything is almost determined by family background based on these kinds of standards. The current system in China looks like a heaven compared to that time, even though we still have abundant reasons to cristicize how bad it is. To blame others/environment is easy, and usually doesn't help much. If there's one reason why people in China live such a difficult lives nowadays and most of history, I'd say it's we and our parents, grandparents and ancestors are so good at blaming others instead of taking responsibilities ourselves, especially among people who may have the potential to bring changes. 

Another further step here, "society shouldn't judge other people to certain standards" indicate that there's unfairness in society and society or others should improve somehow. Human always have such a tendency: lucky people want to prove it's not their lucky but they supposed to be this good with many reasons, their hard-working or ability or morality or whatever goodness in them. Bad lucky people want to find something to prove I'm not evil or lazy or talentless, it's nothing about me but mainly because of unfair environment or bad luck. They both make a lot sense, and both go to a dangerous direction. Marxism is basd on this human need and it fits the deep desire of most Chinese people: it's of course mainly others faults, now we know it's the western and capitalism's fault. Blaming others or something out of our control is usually similiar or just one step from blaming God. This kind of tendency is what Jewish-Christian tradition trying to overcome the most: even though Job can't understand clearly why he's been treated like this, he chose to praise God. Jesus alone doesn't here to condemn how bad and sinful the society is, he suffered the most and faces the ultimate unfairness as he's the only one without sin, he died on cross himself to make it possible for us to follow him. Ultimately, there are only two directions to praise or blame, myself or God. Anything like society or others or big environment that I can't control are part of God's plan. If people want to praise, they should praise God instead of themselves. If people want to blame, they should blame only themselves instead of God. 

The world is full of crazy suffering and unfairness. If we focus on unfairness, the feeling of unfairness relates to suffering. In the book of Job, why a perfect man can suffer as such. This book is talking about jewish people, as well as all human kind. The ultimate qustion to jewish people is not why can't we build a great country and achieve righterousness, but why good people suffer and bad people win. Why people chosen by God is not the winner of the world, but full of suffering and persecution. The nobles in the Spring and Autumn Period, like the aristocrat of traditional France/England, understand that it is their mission to bear the war and death for other common people. In a similar way, Jesus ate his death and faced the ultimate unfairness to cover our sin. Christian as people chosen by God, our call is not to enjoy world as a easy winner, but to understand the responsability and to bear suffering and evil in world. This kind of evil and suffering, is not anything human can improve, can't be changed by any science or knowledge or supreme court in US. If the UN and education try to tell us, with the build of UN and the demise of Nazi, with our reflection and human progress, holocaust will never happen again and human will be happier. That's just a shallow fantasy. There's no such justice and human can never achieve such justice. A group of people think that they can eliminate the evil, but they usually only replace the original evil with another form of evil, if not make things worse. The answer to the ultimate evil and suffering, can't be answered with paper and pen, but by living out our lives with God. 

Yes definitely your value does not come from your intellectual ability, but I don't think the value is form gifted elsewhere either. Most of us will never be a genius in any aspect of life. Einstein didn't write that original sentence, in 1952 he wrote: “There are only a few enlightened people with a lucid mind and style and with good taste within a century. What has been preserved of their work belongs among the most precious possessions of mankind.” 

The value of a person does not come from any of his ability, so one person doesn't have the burden to prove he has such a gift or to boost if he's lucky enough. The value of a person is purly from God! Jesus paid the infinite price so each person's life has infinite price, potentially as precious as Jesus's life, and that price can't be determined by anything human made or created.
