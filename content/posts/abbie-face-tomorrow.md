Someone once asked me  
Can you face leaving the world tomorrow  
I say if god wants it  
I never knew how to run to death  
I will hug and praise it with my memory  
like a warrior who believes he must die  

But the tears I thought could only be wiped away in heaven  
The loneliness that I thought could only be comforted in heaven  
been healed by a kiss from a girl  
I never wanted peace so much  
I never wished to live so much
