>  Mental states do not come before language nor accompany a sequence of words, but are lived and experienced in the context of linguistic expression.

It's wrong from a syntax perspective at first. Help, love, respect, care, when we use these words before the 18th century, they are usually correctly used to describe the relationship between people. Adding a self before these words is simply wrong in syntax, as saying I eat water or drink food or I borrow money from myself. Bear in mind all these words nowadays everywhere, are extremely new and people for generations live without the need of creating such words.

Before trying to define its meaning, it's better to check how we use it. 

1. Your dad drinks too much, he just doesn't love himself.  
Here doesn't love himself=drink too much alcohol, love himself=less alcohol. It's basically a simple complain and doesn't help much. People tend to feel by saying he doesn't love himself, we find something deeper or the root cause why he drinks, but actually apart from getting the cheap pleasure to "explain" with such self or inner focused language, we are just at the exact same position. We don't say he's talkative because he's talkative, looks silly and meaningless, but we say he's talkative because he's an extrovert (a concept we created purely in our mind). But why we mark him as an extrovert is simply by observing he's talkative. 

2. You can't love others properly without loving yourself at first.  
Meaningless, no context. Or it simply means one needs to live a good life, and then can love others.

3. commercial ad: Xx chocolate, love yourself by treating yourself!  
Here love yourself=treat yourself, or please yourself. They just want you to spend money to treat yourself, nothing more.

4. During lockdown: I want to do anything I want. Oh no that's bad that's self love.
See how bad influence these words are if you start to use them. The meaning of "do what I want" during lockdown context simply means we want the lockdown or restrictions to be removed. The self love here is indulgence.  

5. Someone said to a child who failed an exam: no matter what you need to love yourself.  
Ask the child to not be guilty. Actually it's better for us to confirm children's value from God, and give practical suggestions to help to improve. 

Why there are so many different use cases and we still believe it has a consistent meaning. What we actually means in each of these situations and which one is better? Our old clear daily language or new shining concepts.

Then what's the effects by using it? It doesn't have any power. Suicide prevention in train station says: remember there's someone else love you. Why we emphasize someone else loves you, not just love yourself and don't suicide. 'Self-love' hides or preempts better and meaningful suggestions.

Where's it comes from, what's the potential motivation to invent these words? Self centered century. Psychology try to replaces church, some people want to replace all words related to christian or religion. They don't know God and they want to say something about love. Moreover, it's a century to try to dig into our inside. Human have the tendency to know why, to get the pleasure of creating and using words to explain things, give us a feeling like we already found something deeper or know the root of a problem. It's empty, doesn't have any effects. It's a wet with loads of new words but have nothing meaningful and can't actually make any changes. 

The context is the key, the world and environment and relationship among people is the key. There's no such thing like inner world, we tend to imagine like it like biceps and there's a clear connection to our behavior but it's just purely a few characters we created very recently!

Jesus loves us and how much love it is? We hate and curse him and he died for us. We can't say how much I love myself and I die for myself.
