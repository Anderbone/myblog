A few days ago I heard a Chinese podcast talking details of this incident.

The communist army put pigs head in muslim community's well. The tension kept growing, muslim elite from Shadian went to Beijing to talk the situation with communist leaders, when they came back they knew the situation was going to be worse. Obviously they felt what's going to happen, one of the elites begged their Muslim people to send women and children out, but people were so angry and refused and thought he already betrayed to communists. He said if they have to fight he would fight to death and he did.

Communists planned to use 3 hours to clean the village with army and weapon, but the first 100 commies soilders were almost all killed when they went into the village immediately, only 3 survived and fled. Muslims were prepared very well, they had underground factory to make guns and their firepower supported each other very well. Communists used 7 days and 8 nights instead of 3 hours, burned everything in the village.
