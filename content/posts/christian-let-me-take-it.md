Dad shared such a little story recently.

The couple quarreled, the child ran around and found out: you two are not fighting again!

He ran to his dad, "Dad, dad, you just apologize to mom, you guys make up!" Dad sighed sadly and shook his head, "Your mom is not even talking to me right now."

The child rushed to mom's side again, "Mom, mom, you make up with dad, dad is not coming to talk now, but I know his heart is weeping! Mommy, my good mommy, if you must punish, let me take the blame for daddy's fault, let me take the blame! Let you two make up!"

Here I would like to share another story that Zhang Xueliang told about his old man [Zhang Zuolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Zuolin), a legendary warlord, who was most proud of his life.

This is one of my father's favorite stories to tell me. My father had a dozen guns, but this man Haishazi had more than 20.

He passed by a village (the place where I was born, called Bajiaotai, now called Taian County) and asked for a toll. My father refused, saying, "We are the insurance team here, why should you ask for money to pass through here?" Haishazi said, "If you don't pay, I'll fight!" My father said, "I have taken the money of this village, so I have to be responsible for the safety of this village. If we fight, this village will be disrupted. Only the two of us can fight each other, okay? If you kill me, the village will be yours; if I kill you, your men will be mine."

As a result, my father received a bullet in his body, and he killed Hai with one shot, and all of Haishazi's men were given to my father. The gunshot wound on my father's body was the result of this.

Love only happens between people: like a child who is willing to take the punishment for his father; like Zhang Zuolin who was willing to put his life alone at risk so that his folks would be spared from the guns.

It was out of love for us that Jesus willingly went to the cross and bore all the guilt we deserved so that our sins might be forgiven. There was no righteous man, not one, but through the love of Jesus, that those who believe in Him should not perish but have eternal life.

---The Bible is the only way to be righteous.
