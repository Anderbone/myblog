A boy and a girl who have never met       
Will get married next month in Pakistan       
I met that man in Ras Al Khaimah       

When I replaced by we       
Even illness becomes wellness       
I heard it from a man in RAK       

There are deserts everywhere in RAK       
There are some camels in RAK       
There are few birds in RAK       

I was trying to find stars at night in the heat       
Alone with the sounds from a mosque on the streets        
I can't see the stars       
But I know they are there       
Just like I knew you were here
