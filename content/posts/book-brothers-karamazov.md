It's simply the best novel I have ever read. I agree with almost every place in the book where you can feel Dostoevsky’s strong point of view, and laughed with joy.

I convinced my father, few Christian and non-Christian friends to read it, and I'm very happy few people already have it in their hands. I definitely will read it again. 

I read it in Chinese, for different English versions, I compared some reviews and bought the [Ignat Avsey's English translation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Karamazov-Brothers-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199536376). It's in a friend's hands, hope he will enjoy it.
