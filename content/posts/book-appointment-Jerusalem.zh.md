这本书有繁体中文版，相约在圣城，是关于Lydia的真实传记。

Lydia是一位在丹麦生活无忧无虑的女教师，却突然被心中那难以扑灭的探寻信仰的火苗所驱使，凭着祈祷和信心，一步步辞掉了令人艳羡的稳定工作，捐献了全部的遗产，孤身来到耶路撒冷，听从上帝的安排。从极为艰难拮据的生活中，凭着爱心收留下一位婴儿，直到成为许多孤儿的母亲。

书摘如下：

上帝要拿去她第一位收留的孩子时，她是如此不舍和不理解。但Nijmeh告诉她，你不需要理解，只需要相信！其实大多时候，理解就是相信，理解就是跟随。我们当然不可能知道上帝的全部安排，但我们相信上帝的美意。
> Don’t need to understand. We need to trust.” “Pray for me, Nijmeh! I do want to trust—but there’s such a tempest inside me!” For a long while we sat side by side, with Nijmeh’s hand on mine. Finally she said, “I want to share with you a lesson that I learned years ago when I lost my sight: Trusting God is not a feeling; it’s a decision. We can’t always change our feelings, but we can exercise our will.” “But how can I stop being concerned for her?” “You can’t. But you can decide with your will to trust her to God—and then seal your decision by declaring it aloud with your voice.” And there in Nijmeh’s presence I made my decision: “No matter what happens, I will trust God—for Tikva—for myself—for all that lies ahead"

上帝给我们生命，我们全然信靠祂，将自己全然交出去，为祂而活时，祂会给我们更多。
> First God gives to us—Then we give back to God—Finally God gives back again to us—blessed and multiplied beyond our power to imagine.

感受到自己命运的时刻，这时的每一句话都像会被记录在天上。
> choosing my words slowly and carefully with a sense that they were being recorded in heaven, “with Your help—I will take my appointed place—as a watchman on the walls of Jerusalem.

基督徒对耶路撒冷的亏欠。
> I suddenly came to see that we Christians have a debt that has gone unpaid for many centuries—to Israel and to Jerusalem. It is to them that we owe the Bible, the prophets, the apostles, the Savior Himself. For far too long we have forgotten this debt, but now the time has come for us to begin repaying it—and there are two ways that we can do this. First, we need to repent of our sins against Israel: at best, our lack of gratitude and concern; at worst, our open contempt and persecution.

仿佛基督的血已经在她身上流动，她在去世前感谢这血。
> In Danish she frequently repeated, “Tak for blodet!”—“Thank you for the blood!” The weaker her flesh became, the more clearly the strength of her spirit shone forth.

许多事情，如果你不做，就没有人会去做。
> Then say to yourself, “If I don’t do the work, no one else will do it.
