https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-word-lengths/

Given a string array words, return __the maximum value of__ length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) __where the two words do not share common letters__. If no such two words exist, return 0.
 
Example 1:
Input: words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"] Output: 16 Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn". 
Example 2:
Input: words = ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"] Output: 4 Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd". 
Example 3:
Input: words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"] Output: 0 Explanation: No such pair of words. 
 
Constraints:

	2 <= words.length <= 1000
	1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
	words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
