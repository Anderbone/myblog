+++

Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.
Each number in candidates may only be used **once** in the combination.

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
 
**Example 1:**
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8 Output: [ [1,1,6], [1,2,5], [1,7], [2,6] ]

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def combinationSum2(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        candidates.sort()
        res = []
        def dfs(start, target, path):
            if target < 0: return
            elif target == 0:
                res.append(path)
                return
            for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
        # Very important here! We don't use `i > 0` because we always want 
        # to count the first element in this recursive step even if it is the same 
        # as one before. To avoid overcounting, we just ignore the duplicates
        # after the first element.
                if i > start and candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]: continue
                dfs(i+1, target - candidates[i], path + [candidates[i]])

        dfs(0, target, [])
        return res

```
