[Shortest Path in Binary Matrix - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/)

Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return __the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix__. If there is no clear path, return -1.
A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., (0, 0)) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., (n - 1, n - 1)) such that:

All the visited cells of the path are 0.
All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.
 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/example1_1.png)

Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]] Output: 2 

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/example2_1.png)

Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]] Output: 4 

Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]] Output: -1 
 
Constraints:

n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
