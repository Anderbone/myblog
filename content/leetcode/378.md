[Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/)

Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, return __the__ kth __smallest element in the matrix__.
Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).
 
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8 Output: 13 Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13 
Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1 Output: -5 
 
Constraints:

	n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
	1 <= n <= 300
	-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109
	All the rows and columns of matrix are guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.
	1 <= k <= n2

    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)
        hp = []
        for i in range(min(n, k)):
            hp.append((matrix[i][0], i, 0))
            
        heapq.heapify(hp)
        
        while k > 0:
            v, row, col = heapq.heappop(hp)
            k -= 1
            
            if col < n - 1:
                heapq.heappush(hp, (matrix[row][col + 1], row, col + 1))
        return v
```
