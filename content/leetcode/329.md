https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/

Given an m x n integers matrix, return __the length of the longest increasing path in __matrix.
From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).
 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/05/grid1.jpg)Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]] Output: 4 Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9]. 
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/27/tmp-grid.jpg)Input: matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]] Output: 4 Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed. 
Example 3:
Input: matrix = [[1]] Output: 1 
 
Constraints:

	m == matrix.length
	n == matrix[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 200
	0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1
