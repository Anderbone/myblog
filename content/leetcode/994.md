[Rotting Oranges - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

0 representing an empty cell,
1 representing a fresh orange, or
2 representing a rotten orange.Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
Return __the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange__. If __this is impossible, return__ -1.
 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png)

Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],

[0,1,1]] Output: 4 

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]] Output: -1 Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally. 

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[0,2]] Output: 0 Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0. 
 
Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 10
grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.
