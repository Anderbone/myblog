[Min Cost to Connect All Points - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/)

You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
Return __the minimum cost to make all points connected.__ All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.
 
Example 1:

Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]] Output: 20 Explanation: 

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/26/c.png) 

We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20. Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points. 

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]] Output: 18 
 
Constraints:

1 <= points.length <= 1000
-106 <= xi, yi <= 106
All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.

- code #Prim
```py
class Solution:
    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def dis(pi, pj):
            return abs(pi[0] - pj[0]) + abs(pi[1] - pj[1])
        
        cost = 0
        n = len(points)
        visited = [False] * n
        
        cur = 0 # start from point 0
        unconnected = n - 1 # point 0 as connected and visited
        visited[0] = True
        
        pq = []
        heapq.heapify(pq)
        while unconnected > 0:
            for point in range(n):
                if not visited[point]: # from current, to every unvisited point
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (dis(points[cur], points[point]), point))
            
            while pq:
                shortest, j = heapq.heappop(pq)
                if not visited[j]: # j is the shortest unvisited point
                    break
                    
            unconnected -= 1
            cost += shortest
            visited[j] = True
            cur = j # update to next round
            
        return cost

            if cur in visited: continue
                
            visited.add(cur)

            for point in range(n):
                if point not in visited: # from current, to every unvisited point
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (dis(points[cur], points[point]), point))
