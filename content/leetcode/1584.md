[Min Cost to Connect All Points - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/)

You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
Return __the minimum cost to make all points connected.__ All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.
 
Example 1:

Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]] Output: 20 Explanation: 

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/26/c.png) 

We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20. Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points. 

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]] Output: 18 
 
Constraints:

1 <= points.length <= 1000
-106 <= xi, yi <= 106
All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.
