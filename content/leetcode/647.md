https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/

Given a string s, return __the number of palindromic substrings in it__.
A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abc" Output: 3 Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c". 
Example 2:
Input: s = "aaa" Output: 6 Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa". 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	s consists of lowercase English letters.

                    break
                cur_ct += 1
                l -= 1

        for i in range(len(s)):
            count += expand(i, i)
            if i + 1 < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                count += expand(i, i + 1)
                
        return count
