[Max Number of K-Sum Pairs - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-number-of-k-sum-pairs/)

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.
Return __the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array__.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5 Output: 2 Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]: - Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3] - Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = [] There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6 Output: 1 Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]: - Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3] There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.
 
Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
	1 <= k <= 109

```py
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        need_map = defaultdict(int)
        res = 0
        for v in nums:
            if need_map[v] == 0:
                need_map[k - v] += 1
            else:
                need_map[v] -= 1
                res += 1
        return res
```
