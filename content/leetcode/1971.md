[Find if Path Exists in Graph - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/)
There is a **bi-directional** graph with n vertices, where each vertex is labeled from 0 to n - 1 (**inclusive**). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.
You want to determine if there is a **valid path** that exists from vertex start to vertex end.
Given edges and the integers n, start, and end, return true__ if there is a **valid path** from __start__ to __end__, or __false__ otherwise____.__
 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex1.png)

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], start = 0, end = 2 Output: true Explanation: There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2: - 0 → 1 → 2 - 0 → 2

- code DFS recursion
```py
class Solution:
    def validPath(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        if not edges: return start == end
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for v, e in edges:
            adj[v].append(e)
            adj[e].append(v)
            
        def dfs(v):
            if v == end:
                return True
            while adj[v]:
                if dfs(adj[v].pop()):
                    return True
            return False
            
        return dfs(start)
```
- code  DFS, while loop
```py
class Solution:
    def validPath(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        adja = [[] for i in range(n)]
        for i, j in edges:
            adja[i].append(j)
            adja[j].append(i)
            
        stack = [start]
        visited = set(stack)
        while stack:
            cur = stack.pop()
            if cur == end:
                return True
            for nei in adja[cur]:
                if nei not in visited:
                    stack.append(nei)
                    visited.add(nei)
        return False
```
