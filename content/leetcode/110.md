Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1. 
**Example 1:**

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def helper(root, isBalanced = True):
            if not root:
                return (-1, True) # height, isBalanced
            left_height, left_balance = helper(root.left)
            right_height, right_balance = helper(root.right)
            height = 1 + max(left_height, right_height)
            isBalanced = left_balance and right_balance and abs(left_height - right_height) <= 1
            return (height, isBalanced)

        return helper(root)[1]

```
