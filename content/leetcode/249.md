[Group Shifted Strings - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-shifted-strings/)

We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.

For example, "abc" can be shifted to be "bcd".We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.

For example, we can keep shifting "abc" to form the sequence: "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz".Given an array of strings strings, group all strings[i] that belong to the same shifting sequence. You may return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: strings = ["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"] Output: [["acef"],["a","z"],["abc","bcd","xyz"],["az","ba"]] 

Example 2:
Input: strings = ["a"] Output: [["a"]] 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= strings.length <= 200
	1 <= strings[i].length <= 50
	strings[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def groupStrings(self, strings: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
            d = defaultdict(list)
            for s in strings:
                # key = "".join(chr((ord(c)-ord(s[0]))%26) for c in s)
                key = tuple((ord(c) - ord(s[0])) % 26 for c in s)
                d[key].append(s)
            return list(d.values())
        
```
Python, -2 % 5 = 3, it's like (-2 + 5) % 5
- code wrong, thought it means consecutive numbers
```py
class Solution:
    def groupStrings(self, strings: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        group = defaultdict(list)
        res = []
        
        def getDirection(x, y):
            diff = ord(x) - ord(y)
            if diff == 1 or diff == -25: return 1
            elif diff == -1 or diff == 25: return -1
            else: return 0
            
        for s in strings:
            if len(s) == 1: 
                group[1].append(s)
                continue
            direction = getDirection(s[1], s[0])
            if direction == 0: 
                res.append([s])
                continue
            for i in range(2, len(s)):
                if getDirection(s[i], s[i-1]) != direction:
                    res.append([s])
                    continue
            group[(len(s), direction)].append(s)
            
        for k, v in group.items():
            res.append(v)
            
        return res
```
