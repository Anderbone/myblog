Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return __the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.__
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
 
**Example 1:**
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2] Output: 4 Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res, nums_set = 0, set(nums)

        for num in nums:
            if num - 1 in nums_set: continue
            cur_longest = 1
            while num + cur_longest in nums_set:
                cur_longest += 1
            res = max(res, cur_longest)
        return res

```
