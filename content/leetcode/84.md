Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return __the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram__.
 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/histogram.jpg)

Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3] Output: 10 Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1. The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        # maintain a strictly increasing stack, so we know the leftmost easily
        stack = [-1] # if empty, when we pop out the first element, we can't calculate the width easily
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            while stack[-1] != -1 and heights[i] <= heights[stack[-1]]:
                # pop out stack[-1] and calculate its max area 
                cur_height = heights[stack.pop()]
                cur_width = i - 1 - stack[-1] # not include the bar at i
                res = max(res, cur_height * cur_width)
            stack.append(i)
                
        # to the rightmost already
        while stack[-1] != -1:
            cur_height = heights[stack.pop()]
            cur_width = len(heights) - 1 - stack[-1]
            res = max(res, cur_height * cur_width)
            
        return res
