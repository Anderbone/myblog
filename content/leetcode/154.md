+++

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return __the minimum element of this array__.
You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5] Output: 1 
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1] Output: 0

```py
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:    
        low = 0
        high = len(nums)-1
        while high > low:
            pivot = low + (high - low) // 2
            # risk of overflow: pivot = (low + high) // 2
            # Case 1):
            if nums[pivot] < nums[high]:
                high = pivot 
                # alternative: high = pivot - 1
                # too aggressive to move the `high` index,
                # it won't work for the test case of [3, 1, 3]
            # Case 2):
            elif nums[pivot] > nums[high]:
                low = pivot + 1
            # Case 3):
            else:
                high -= 1
        # the 'low' and 'high' index converge to the inflection point.
        return nums[low]
```

        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        res = nums[0]
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r-l) // 2
            if nums[l] < nums[mid]: # left sorted
                res = min(res, nums[l])
                l = mid
            elif nums[mid] < nums[r]: # right sorted
                res = min(res, nums[mid])
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                return min(res, min(nums[l:r+1]))
        return res
