[Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60 - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/)

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.
Return __the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by__ 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.
 
Example 1:
Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40] Output: 3 Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60: (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180 (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120 (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60 
Example 2:
Input: time = [60,60,60] Output: 3 Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60. 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104
	1 <= time[i] <= 500

            elif t in needs:

            needs[60 - t] += 1
