+++

Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.
Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2 Output: 18 Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays. The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18. 
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2 Output: 9

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def splitArray(self, nums: List[int], m: int) -> int:
        l, r = max(nums), sum(nums)
        ans = r
        
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r-l) // 2
            sub_sum = 0
            ct = 1 # not 0
            for v in nums:
                if sub_sum + v > mid:
                    sub_sum = v # not 0
                    ct += 1
                else:
                    sub_sum += v
                
            if ct > m:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, mid)
                r = mid - 1
        return ans
```
