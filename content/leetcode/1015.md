[Smallest Integer Divisible by K - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/)

Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.
Return __the length of __n. If there is no such n, return -1.
Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
 
Example 1:
Input: k = 1 Output: 1 Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1. 
Example 2:
Input: k = 2 Output: -1 Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2. 
Example 3:
Input: k = 3 Output: 3 Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3. 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= k <= 105

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, k: int) -> int:
        n = 1
        
        for length in range(1, k+1):
            if n % k == 0: return length
            n = n * 10 + 1
            n = n % k
            
        return -1
```
