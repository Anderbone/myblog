Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.
 
**Example 1:**  
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/rotate1.jpg)

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2 Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return None
        run_count = head
        count = 1
        while run_count and run_count.next:
            run_count = run_count.next
            count += 1
        last = run_count

        if k % count == 0:
            return head
        first_half_count = count - k % count - 1

        run_count = head
        while first_half_count:
            run_count = run_count.next
            first_half_count -= 1
        new_head = run_count.next
        run_count.next = None
        last.next = head

        return new_head

```
- code   same
```py
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        
        if not head:
            return None
        
        lastElement = head
        length = 1
        # get the length of the list and the last node in the list
        while ( lastElement.next ):
            lastElement = lastElement.next
            length += 1

        # If k is equal to the length of the list then k == 0
        # ElIf k is greater than the length of the list then k = k % length
        k = k % length
            
        # Set the last node to point to head node
        # The list is now a circular linked list with last node pointing to first node
        lastElement.next = head
        
        # Traverse the list to get to the node just before the ( length - k )th node.
        # Example: In 1->2->3->4->5, and k = 2
        #          we need to get to the Node(3)
        tempNode = head
        for _ in range( length - k - 1 ):
            tempNode = tempNode.next
        
        # Get the next node from the tempNode and then set the tempNode.next as None
        # Example: In 1->2->3->4->5, and k = 2
        #          tempNode = Node(3)
        #          answer = Node(3).next => Node(4)
        #          Node(3).next = None ( cut the linked list from here )
        answer = tempNode.next
        tempNode.next = None
        
        return answer
