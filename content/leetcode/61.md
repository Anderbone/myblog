[Rotate List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.
 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/rotate1.jpg)Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2 Output: [4,5,1,2,3] 
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/roate2.jpg)Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4 Output: [2,0,1] 
 
Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
	0 <= k <= 2 * 109

    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return None
        run_count = head
        count = 1
        while run_count and run_count.next:
            run_count = run_count.next
            count += 1
        last = run_count

        if k % count == 0:
            return head
        first_half_count = count - k % count - 1

        run_count = head
        while first_half_count:
            run_count = run_count.next
            first_half_count -= 1
        new_head = run_count.next
        run_count.next = None
        last.next = head

        return new_head
