        stack = []

        last_index = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c not in seen:
                while stack and c < stack[-1] and i < last_index[stack[-1]]:
                    seen.discard(stack.pop())
                stack.append(c)
                seen.add(c)
