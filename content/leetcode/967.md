https://leetcode.com/problems/numbers-with-same-consecutive-differences/

Return all **non-negative** integers of length n such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is k.
Note that **every** number in the answer **must not** have leading zeros. For example, 01 has one leading zero and is invalid.
You may return the answer in **any order**.
 
**Example 1:**
**Input:** n = 3, k = 7 **Output:** [181,292,707,818,929] **Explanation:** Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes. 
**Example 2:**
**Input:** n = 2, k = 1 **Output:** [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98] 
 
**Constraints:**
 	
	2 <= n <= 9 	
	0 <= k <= 9

            int last = cur % 10;
            if (last >= diff) build(cur * 10 + last - diff);
