https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/

There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.
A __critical connection__ is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.
Return all critical connections in the network in any order.
 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/03/1537_ex1_2.png)Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]] Output: [[1,3]] Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted. 
Example 2:
Input: n = 2, connections = [[0,1]] Output: [[0,1]] 
 
Constraints:

	2 <= n <= 105
	n - 1 <= connections.length <= 105
	0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
	ai != bi
	There are no repeated connections.
