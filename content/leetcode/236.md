Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        if root in (None, p, q): return root
        left, right = (self.lowestCommonAncestor(kid, p, q)
                    for kid in (root.left, root.right))
        return root if left and right else left or right

```
 It’s recursive and expands the meaning of the function. If the current (sub)tree contains both p and q, then the function result is their LCA. If only one of them is in that subtree, then the result is that one of them. If neither are in that subtree, the result is null/None/nil.
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        def helper(root, p, q):
            if not root:
                return (0, None)
            ansl = helper(root.left, p, q)
            if ansl[0] == 2:
                return ansl
            ansr = helper(root.right, p, q)
            if ansr[0] == 2:
                return ansr
            count = ansl[0]+ ansr[0] + (p, q).count(root)
            return (count, root if count==2 else None)

        return helper(root, p, q)[1]

```
