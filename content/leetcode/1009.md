[Complement of Base 10 Integer - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/)

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.Given an integer n, return __its complement__.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 5 Output: 2 Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10. 
Example 2:
Input: n = 7 Output: 0 Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10. 
Example 3:
Input: n = 10 Output: 5 Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10. 
 
Constraints:

	0 <= n < 109

[476. Number Complement Â· Jiyu (yanjiyu.com)](https://yanjiyu.com/leetcode/476/) Only difference is here we need to handle 0.
- code
```java
class Solution {
    public int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        int round = n, bit = 1;
        while (round != 0){
            n = n ^ bit;
            bit = bit << 1;
            round = round >> 1;
        }
        return n;
    }
}
```
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def bitwiseComplement(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0: return 1
        return (1 << n.bit_length()) - 1 - n
```
