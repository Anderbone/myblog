https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sorted-vowel-strings/

Given an integer n, return __the number of strings of length __n__ that consist only of vowels (__a__, __e__, __i__, __o__, __u__) and are lexicographically sorted.__
A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 1 Output: 5 Explanation: The 5 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are ["a","e","i","o","u"].
Example 2:
Input: n = 2 Output: 15 Explanation: The 15 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are ["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"]. Note that "ea" is not a valid string since 'e' comes after 'a' in the alphabet. 
Example 3:
Input: n = 33 Output: 66045 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= n <= 50
