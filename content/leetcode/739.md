Given a list of daily temperatures temperatures, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.
For example, given the list of temperatures temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].
**Note:** The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T):
        #initialize the result array with all '0's considering when there is no bigger temperature
        ans = [0]*len(T) 
        stack = []
        
        for i,v in enumerate(T):
            #check whether current val is greater than the last appended stack value.  We will pop all the elements which is lesser than the current temp
            while stack and T[stack[-1]] < v:
                index = stack.pop()
                ans[index] = i - index # we are checking how many indices we have crossed since we last have a lesser temperature
            #Remember since we are comparing all the stack elements before inserting,all the stack elements will have temperatures greater than the current value   
            stack.append(i)
        
        return ans
