tags = ["leetcode","dp"]
+++
You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/15/lc-domino.jpg)

Given an integer n, return __the number of ways to tile an__ 2 x n __board__. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.
 
Example 1:
