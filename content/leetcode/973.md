[K Closest Points to Origin - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/closestplane1.jpg)

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1 Output: [[-2,2]] Explanation: The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10). The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8). Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin. We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]]. 
Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2 Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]] Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted. 
 
Constraints:

 1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
 -104 < xi, yi < 104

"As the efficiency of this solution relies on averaging as close to a middle split of the points as possible on each iteration of the binary search, the use of Euclidean distances will be more efficient than the use of squared Euclidean distances. "
The binary search solution works with squared distance as well. But on each iteration, the actual Euclidean distance will guarantee us to do the "Binary" search, which uses the exact middle distance to split the remaining points.
Suppose the actual Euclidean distance is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, we will use (1+7)/2 = 4 to split it evenly.
But with squared distance, it's 1,4,9,16.25,36,49, we will choose (1+49)/2 = 25 as the middle point to split it, it's uneven, though we still can get a correct result.
