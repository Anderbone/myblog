[Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/)

You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2 Output: "abcd" Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
Example 2:
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3 Output: "aa" Explanation: First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa" Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa" Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
Example 3:
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2 Output: "ps" 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 105
	2 <= k <= 104
	s only contains lower case English letters.

    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        stack = []
        res = list(s)
        quick = slow = 0
        while quick < len(s):
            res[slow] = res[quick]
            if (slow == 0 or res[slow] != res[slow - 1]):
                stack.append(1)
            else:
                inc = stack.pop() + 1
                if inc == k:
                    slow -= k
                else:
                    stack.append(inc)
            quick += 1
            slow += 1
            
        return "".join(res[:slow])
```
