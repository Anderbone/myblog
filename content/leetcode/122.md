You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.
Find and return __the **maximum** profit you can achieve__.
 
**Example 1:**
**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] **Output:** 7 **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3. Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7. 
**Example 2:**
**Input:** prices = [1,2,3,4,5] **Output:** 4 **Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Total profit is 4. 
**Example 3:**
**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1] **Output:** 0 **Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0. 
 
**Constraints:**
 	
	1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104 	
	0 <= prices[i] <= 104

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            if (prices[i] - prices[i-1] > 0){
                res += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
code
```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            diff = prices[i] - prices[i-1]
            if diff > 0:
                profit += diff
        return profit
```
