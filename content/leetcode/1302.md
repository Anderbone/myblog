https://leetcode.com/problems/deepest-leaves-sum/

Given the root of a binary tree, return __the sum of values of its deepest leaves__. 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/31/1483_ex1.png)Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8] Output: 15 
Example 2:
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5] Output: 19 
 
Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
	1 <= Node.val <= 100

```py
class Solution:
    def deepestLeavesSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        level = [root]
        while level:
            nex = [i for node in level for i in (node.left, node.right) if i]
            if not nex: return sum(i.val for i in level)
            level = nex
```
