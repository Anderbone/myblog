[Detect Capital - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-capital/)

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals in it is right.
 
Example 1:
Input: word = "USA" Output: true 

Example 2:
Input: word = "FlaG" Output: false 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= word.length <= 100
	word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
