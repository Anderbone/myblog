[Middle of the Linked List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

Given the head of a singly linked list, return __the middle node of the linked list__.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
 
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5] Output: [3,4,5] Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3. 
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6] Output: [4,5,6] Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one. 
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
