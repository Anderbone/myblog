Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.
The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).
 
Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/28/all_1.jpg)

Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]] Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

        target = len(graph) - 1
        results = []

        def backtrack(currNode, path):
            # if we reach the target, no need to explore further.
            if currNode == target:
                results.append(list(path))
                return
            # explore the neighbor nodes one after another.
            for nextNode in graph[currNode]:
                path.append(nextNode)
                backtrack(nextNode, path)
                path.pop()
        # kick of the backtracking, starting from the source node (0).
        path = deque([0])
        backtrack(0, path)

        return results
```
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        def dfs(cur, path):
            if cur == len(graph) - 1:
                res.append(path + [cur])
                return
            for next_node in graph[cur]:
                dfs(next_node, path + [cur])
                
        dfs(0, [])
        return res
```
