https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/

You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.
Return __the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree__.
 
**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png)**Input:** root = [0,0,null,0,0] **Output:** 1 **Explanation:** One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown. 
**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)**Input:** root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0] **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement. 
 
**Constraints:**
 	
	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. 	
	Node.val == 0

                dfs(node.right, node)
                
                if node.left not in covered \
                or node.right not in covered \
                or (node not in covered and parent is None):
                    self.res += 1
                    covered.update({node, node.left, node.right, parent})
        dfs(root)
        return self.res
```
