[Find Permutation - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-permutation/)

A permutation perm of n integers of all the integers in the range [1, n] can be represented as a string s of length n - 1 where:

	s[i] == 'I' if perm[i] < perm[i + 1], and
	s[i] == 'D' if perm[i] > perm[i + 1].Given a string s, reconstruct the lexicographically smallest permutation perm and return it.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "I" Output: [1,2] Explanation: [1,2] is the only legal permutation that can represented by s, where the number 1 and 2 construct an increasing relationship. 
Example 2:
Input: s = "DI" Output: [2,1,3] Explanation: Both [2,1,3] and [3,1,2] can be represented as "DI", but since we want to find the smallest lexicographical permutation, you should return [2,1,3] 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 105
	s[i] is either 'I' or 'D'.

    public int[] findPermutation(String s) {
        int[] res = new int[s.length() + 1];
        ArrayDeque <Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i - 1) == 'I') {
                stack.push(i);
                while (!stack.isEmpty())
                    res[j++] = stack.pop();
            } else
                stack.push(i);
        }
        stack.push(s.length() + 1);

            res[j++] = stack.pop();
