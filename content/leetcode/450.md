Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.  
**Follow up:** Can you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?
- code
```py
class Solution(object):
    def deleteNode(self, root, key):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type key: int
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if not root: return None
        
        if root.val == key:
            if root.left:
                # Find the right most leaf of the left sub-tree
                left_right_most = root.left
                while left_right_most.right:
                    left_right_most = left_right_most.right
                # Attach right child to the right of that leaf
                left_right_most.right = root.right
                # Return left child instead of root, a.k.a delete root
                return root.left
            else:
                return root.right
        # If left or right child got deleted, the returned root is the child of the deleted node.
        elif root.val > key:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        else:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
            
        return root
```
