[Power of Two - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)

Given an integer n, return __true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false__.
An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 1 Output: true Explanation: 20 = 1 
Example 2:
Input: n = 16 Output: true Explanation: 24 = 16 
Example 3:
Input: n = 3 Output: false 
 
Constraints:
-231 <= n <= 231 - 1

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        while n > 1:
            if n % 2 != 0: return False
            n = n // 2
        return n == 1
```
power of 2
a power of two in binary representation is one 1-bit, followed by some zeros:
1 = (0000 0001)_21=(00000001)2​  
2 = (0000 0010)_22=(00000010)2​  
4 = (0000 0100)_24=(00000100)2​  
8 = (0000 1000)_28=(00001000)2​  
A number which is not a power of two, has more than one 1-bit in its binary representation:
3 = (0000 0011)_23=(00000011)2​  
5 = (0000 0101)_25=(00000101)2​  
6 = (0000 0110)_26=(00000110)2​  
7 = (0000 0111)_27=(00000111)2​  
The only exception is 0, which should be treated separately.
