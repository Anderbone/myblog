https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/

A string s is called **good** if there are no two different characters in s that have the same **frequency**.
Given a string s, return__ the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make __s__ **good**.__
The **frequency** of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the **frequency** of 'a' is 2, while the **frequency** of 'b' is 1.
 
**Example 1:**
**Input:** s = "aab" **Output:** 0 **Explanation:** s is already good. 
**Example 2:**
**Input:** s = "aaabbbcc" **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc". Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
**Example 3:**
**Input:** s = "ceabaacb" **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab". Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored). 
 
**Constraints:**
 	
	1 <= s.length <= 105 	
	s contains only lowercase English letters.
