The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
Given an integer n, return __all distinct solutions to the **n-queens puzzle**__. You may return the answer in **any order**.
Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.
 
**Example 1:**  
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/queens.jpg)Input: n = 4 Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]] Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above

                board[i][col_start] = "N" # Q makes it invalid

                board[row][col] = "N"
            row, col = row_start, col_start
            while 0 <= row - 1 < n and 0 <= col + 1 < n:
                row, col = row - 1, col + 1

                    new_board = put_queue(board, queue_row, col)
                    dfs(queue_row + 1, new_board)
                    board = copy.deepcopy(old_board)

- code https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/discuss/19810
```py  
class Solution:
    def solveNQueens(self, n):
        def DFS(queens, xy_dif, xy_sum):
            p = len(queens)
            if p==n:
                result.append(queens)
                return None
            for q in range(n):
                if q not in queens and p-q not in xy_dif and p+q not in xy_sum: 
                    DFS(queens+[q], xy_dif+[p-q], xy_sum+[p+q])  
        result = []
        DFS([],[],[])
        return [ ["."*i + "Q" + "."*(n-i-1) for i in sol] for sol in result]

```
whenever a location (x, y) is occupied, any other locations (p, q ) where p + q = =  x + y or p - q = =  x - y would be invalid. We can use this information to keep track of the indicators (xy_dif and xy_sum ) of the invalid positions and then call DFS recursively with valid positions only.
At the end, we convert the result (a list of lists; each sublist is the indices of the queens) into the desire format.
