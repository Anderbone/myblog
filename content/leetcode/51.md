[N-Queens - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
Given an integer n, return __all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle__. You may return the answer in any order.
Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.
 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/queens.jpg)Input: n = 4 Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]] Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above 

Example 2:
Input: n = 1 Output: [["Q"]] 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= n <= 9

class Solution:
    def solveNQueens(self, n):
        def DFS(queens, xy_dif, xy_sum):
            p = len(queens)
            if p==n:
                result.append(queens)
                return None
            for q in range(n):
                if q not in queens and p-q not in xy_dif and p+q not in xy_sum: 
                    DFS(queens+[q], xy_dif+[p-q], xy_sum+[p+q])  
        result = []
        DFS([],[],[])
        return [ ["."*i + "Q" + "."*(n-i-1) for i in sol] for sol in result]

```
whenever a location (x, y) is occupied, any other locations (p, q ) where p + q = =  x + y or p - q = =  x - y would be invalid. We can use this information to keep track of the indicators (xy_dif and xy_sum ) of the invalid positions and then call DFS recursively with valid positions only.
At the end, we convert the result (a list of lists; each sublist is the indices of the queens) into the desire format.
