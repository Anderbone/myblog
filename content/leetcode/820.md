https://leetcode.com/problems/short-encoding-of-words/

A **valid encoding** of an array of words is any reference string s and array of indices indices such that:
 	
	words.length == indices.length 	
	The reference string s ends with the '#' character. 	
	For each index indices[i], the **substring** of s starting from indices[i] and up to (but not including) the next '#' character is equal to words[i].Given an array of words, return __the **length of the shortest reference string** __s__ possible of any **valid encoding** of __words__.__
 
**Example 1:**
**Input:** words = ["time", "me", "bell"] **Output:** 10 **Explanation:** A valid encoding would be s = "time#bell#" and indices = [0, 2, 5]. words[0] = "time", the substring of s starting from indices[0] = 0 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#" words[1] = "me", the substring of s starting from indices[1] = 2 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#" words[2] = "bell", the substring of s starting from indices[2] = 5 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#" 
**Example 2:**
**Input:** words = ["t"] **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** A valid encoding would be s = "t#" and indices = [0]. 
 
**Constraints:**
 	
	1 <= words.length <= 2000 	
	1 <= words[i].length <= 7 	
	words[i] consists of only lowercase letters.
