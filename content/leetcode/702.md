This is an __interactive problem__.
You have a sorted array of unique elements and an unknown size. You do not have an access to the array but you can use the ArrayReader interface to access it. You can call ArrayReader.get(i) that:

	returns the value at the ith index (0-indexed) of the secret array (i.e., secret[i]), or
	returns 231 - 1 if the i is out of the boundary of the array.You are also given an integer target.
Return the index k of the hidden array where secret[k] == target or return -1 otherwise.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 
Example 1:
Input: secret = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9 Output: 4 Explanation: 9 exists in secret and its index is 4.

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def search(self, reader, target):
        """
        :type reader: ArrayReader
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        l, r = 0, 10000
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r-l) // 2
            if reader.get(mid) == 2 ** 31 - 1 or reader.get(mid) > target:
                r = mid - 1
            elif reader.get(mid) < target:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid
        return -1
        
```
