[Reorder List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
__Reorder the list to be on the following form:__
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → … 
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.
 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)Input: head = [1,2,3,4] Output: [1,4,2,3] 
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5] Output: [1,5,2,4,3] 
 
Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
	1 <= Node.val <= 1000
