[Top K Frequent Words - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/)

Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return __the __k__ most frequent strings__.
Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.
 
Example 1:
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2 Output: ["i","love"] Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words. Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order. 
Example 2:
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4 Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"] Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively. 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= words.length <= 500
	1 <= words[i] <= 10
	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
	k is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]

            freq.put(word, freq.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // min heap, pop out the least frequency or the bigger lexi word
        PriorityQueue<String> q = new PriorityQueue<>( (a, b) ->
            freq.get(a) == freq.get(b) ? b.compareTo(a) : freq.get(a) - freq.get(b)
        );
        
        for (String word: freq.keySet()){
            q.offer(word);
            if (q.size() > k){
                q.poll();
            }
        }
        
        String[] res = new String[k];
        for (int i = k-1; i >= 0; --i){
            res[i] = q.poll();
        }
        return Arrays.asList(res);
    }
