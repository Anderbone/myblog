[Number Complement - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.Given an integer num, return __its complement__.
 
Example 1:
Input: num = 5 Output: 2 Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2. 

Example 2:
Input: num = 1 Output: 0 Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0. 
 
Constraints:

1 <= num < 231

```py
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num):
        # bitmask has the same length as num and contains only ones 1...1
        bitmask = num
        bitmask |= (bitmask >> 1)
        bitmask |= (bitmask >> 2)
        bitmask |= (bitmask >> 4)
        bitmask |= (bitmask >> 8)
        bitmask |= (bitmask >> 16)
        # flip all bits
        return bitmask ^ num
```
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        reverse = []
        num_bin = bin(num)
        for i in range(2, len(num_bin)):
            reverse.append(str(int(num_bin[i]) ^ 1))
        return int("".join(reverse), 2)
```
- code
```java
class Solution {
  public int findComplement(int num) {
    return (Integer.highestOneBit(num) << 1) - num - 1;
  }
}
```
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num):
        return ((1 << num.bit_length()) - 1 ) ^ num
```
