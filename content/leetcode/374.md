We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns 3 possible results:

	-1: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
	1: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
	0: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. pick == num).Return __the number that I picked__.
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        start, end = 1, n
        while True:
            mid = start + (end - start) // 2
            if guess(mid) == 1:
                start = mid + 1
            elif guess(mid) == -1:
                end = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid



```
