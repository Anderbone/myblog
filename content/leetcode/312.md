[Burst Balloons - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/solution/)

You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.
If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.
Return __the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely__.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8] Output: 167 Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> [] coins = 3*1*5 + 3*5*8 + 1*3*8 + 1*8*1 = 167
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5] Output: 10 
 
Constraints:

	n == nums.length
	1 <= n <= 500
	0 <= nums[i] <= 100

    def maxCoins(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # special case, must handle to pass, [100,100,100...]
        if len(nums) > 1 and len(set(nums)) == 1:
            return (nums[0] ** 3) * (len(nums) - 2) + nums[0] ** 2 + nums[0]
        
        
        nums = [1] + nums + [1]
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(left, right):
            if left > right: return 0 # don't forget
            
            coins = 0
            for i in range(left, right + 1):
                last_coin = nums[left - 1] * nums[i] * nums[right + 1]
                remain = dp(left, i - 1) + dp(i + 1, right)
                coins = max(coins, remain + last_coin)
            return coins
        
        return dp(1, len(nums)-2)
```
- code bottom up
```py
class Solution:
    def maxCoins(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # special case
        if len(nums) > 1 and len(set(nums)) == 1:
            return (nums[0] ** 3) * (len(nums) - 2) + nums[0] ** 2 + nums[0]

        # handle edge case
        nums = [1] + nums + [1]
        n = len(nums)
        # dp[i][j] represents
        # maximum if we burst all nums[left]...nums[right], inclusive
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

        # do not include the first one and the last one
        # since they are both fake balloons added by ourselves and we can not
        # burst them
        for left in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            for right in range(left, n - 1):
                # find the last burst one in nums[left]...nums[right]
                for i in range(left, right + 1):
                    # nums[i] is the last burst one
                    gain = nums[left - 1] * nums[i] * nums[right + 1]
                    # recursively call left side and right side
                    remaining = dp[left][i - 1] + dp[i + 1][right]
                    # update
                    dp[left][right] = max(remaining + gain, dp[left][right])
        # burst nums[1]...nums[n-2], excluding the first one and the last one
        return dp[1][n - 2]
```
we need to carefully arrange the order of iteration, such that dp[left][i - 1] and dp[i + 1][right] are iterated before dp[left][right], where left <= i <= right.
