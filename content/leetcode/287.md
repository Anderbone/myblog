Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only **one repeated number** in nums, return __this repeated number__.
You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.
 
**Example 1:**
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2] Output: 2
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = fast = finder = 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
       
            if slow == fast:
                while finder != slow:
                    finder = nums[finder]
                    slow = nums[slow]
                return finder
