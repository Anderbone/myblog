Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only **one repeated number** in nums, return __this repeated number__.
You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.
 
**Example 1:**
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2] Output: 2

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = fast = finder = 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
       
            if slow == fast:
                while finder != slow:
                    finder = nums[finder]
                    slow = nums[slow]
                return finder

It's the same thing as leetcode 142.

The length of the circle is n = x + y.
The fast and slow will meet, and fast traveled m + kn + y.
Slow travelled m+y.
The fast is two times as fast, so m + kn + y = 2(m + y).
We can get m = x + n(k-1), n(k-1) is keep running on the circle, so eventually one from the meeting point, one from the start point, 
they will meet at the point where the circle begins.
