Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank **every day**.
He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the **previous Monday**.
Given n, return __the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the __nth__ day.__
 
**Example 1:**
**Input:** n = 4 **Output:** 10 **Explanation:** After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. 
**Example 2:**
**Input:** n = 10 **Output:** 37 **Explanation:** After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2. 
**Example 3:**
**Input:** n = 20 **Output:** 96 **Explanation:** After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96. 
 
**Constraints:**
 	
	1 <= n <= 1000

class Solution {
    public int totalMoney(int n) {
      int week = n / 7 + 1; 
      int dayInWeek = n % 7;
      int res = 0;

      int start = week;
      while (dayInWeek > 0){
          res += start;
          start++;
          dayInWeek--;
      }
      for (int i = 1; i < week; i++){
        res += 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + (i-1) * 7;
      }
      return res;
    }
