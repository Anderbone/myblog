[Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-visiting-all-nodes/)

You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge.
Return __the length of the shortest path that visits every node__. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.
 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/12/shortest1-graph.jpg)Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]] Output: 4 Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3] 
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/12/shortest2-graph.jpg)Input: graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]] Output: 4 Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3] 
 
Constraints:

	n == graph.length
	1 <= n <= 12
	0 <= graph[i].length < n
	graph[i] does not contain i.
	If graph[a] contains b, then graph[b] contains a.
	The input graph is always connected.

                    if (nei, nexmask) not in visited:
                        visited.add((nei, nexmask))
