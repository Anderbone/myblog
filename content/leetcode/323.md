[Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)
You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph.
Return __the number of connected components in the graph__.
 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/conn1-graph.jpg)Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]] Output: 2

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        root = [i for i in range(n)]
        rank = [1] * n
        self.valid_union_count = 0
        
        def find(x):
            if x == root[x]:
                return x
            root[x] = find(root[x])
            return root[x]
        
        def union(x, y):
            rtx = find(x)
            rty = find(y)
            if rtx == rty:
                return
            if rank[x] > rank[y]:
                root[rty] = rtx
            elif rank[x] < rank[y]:
                root[rtx] = rty
            else:
                root[rty] = rtx
                rank[rtx] += 1
            self.valid_union_count += 1
                
        for x, y in edges:
            union(x, y)
            
        return n - self.valid_union_count
