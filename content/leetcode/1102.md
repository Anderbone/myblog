[Path With Maximum Minimum Value - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-minimum-value/)

Given an m x n integer matrix grid, return __the maximum score of a path starting at __(0, 0)__ and ending at __(m - 1, n - 1) moving in the 4 cardinal directions.
The score of a path is the minimum value in that path.

	For example, the score of the path 8 → 4 → 5 → 9 is 4. 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/05/maxgrid1.jpg)Input: grid = [[5,4,5],[1,2,6],[7,4,6]] Output: 4 Explanation: The path with the maximum score is highlighted in yellow. 
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/05/maxgrid2.jpg)Input: grid = [[2,2,1,2,2,2],[1,2,2,2,1,2]] Output: 2 
Example 3:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/05/maxgrid3.jpg)Input: grid = [[3,4,6,3,4],[0,2,1,1,7],[8,8,3,2,7],[3,2,4,9,8],[4,1,2,0,0],[4,6,5,4,3]] Output: 3 
 
Constraints:

	m == grid.length
	n == grid[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 100
	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 109
