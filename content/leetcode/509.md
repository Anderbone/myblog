he **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).
 
**Example 1:**
Input: n = 2 Output: 1 Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

```py
class Solution:
    def fib(self, N: int) -> int:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i in range(N): a, b = b, a + b
        return a

```py
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        cache = {0:0,1:1}
        def helper(n):
            if n in cache:
                return cache[n]
            cur = helper(n-1) + helper(n-2)
            cache[n] = cur
            return cur
        return helper(n)
