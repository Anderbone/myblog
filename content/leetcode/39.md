Given an array of **distinct** integers candidates and a target integer target, return __a list of all **unique combinations** of __candidates__ where the chosen numbers sum to __target__.__ You may return the combinations in **any order**.
The **same** number may be chosen from candidates an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
It is **guaranteed** that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.
 
**Example 1:**
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7 Output: [[2,2,3],[7]] Explanation: 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times. 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7. These are the only two combinations.  
**Example 2:**
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8 Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

- code naive dp
```py
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = {}
        for candidate in candidates:
            res[candidate] = [[candidate]]

        for i in range(target + 1):
            for candidate in candidates:
                if i in res:
                    next = []
                    for temp in res[i]:
                        if candidate >= max(temp):
                            next.append(temp + [candidate])
                    if next != []:
                        if i + candidate in res:
                            res[i + candidate].extend(next)
                        else:
                            res[i + candidate] = next

        return [] if target not in res else res[target]



```
- code better dp
```py
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        dp = {index:[] for index in range(target + 1)}
        dp[0] = [[]]
        
        for candidate in candidates:
            for index in range(candidate, target + 1):
                for combo in dp[index - candidate]:
                    dp[index].append(combo + [candidate])

        return dp[target]

```
- code better dfs, use nums[i:] as candidates to avoid repetition.
```py
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        def dfs(nums, target, path):
            if target < 0:
                return
            elif target == 0:
                res.append(path)
                return
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                dfs(nums[i:], target - nums[i], path + [nums[i]])

        dfs(candidates, target, [])
        return res

```
- code bfs
```py
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        q = collections.deque([[c] for c in candidates])
        res = []
        while q:
            cur = q.popleft()
            if sum(cur) == target and sorted(cur) not in res:
                res.append(sorted(cur))
            for candidate in candidates:
                if sum(cur + [candidate]) <= target:
                    q.append(cur + [candidate])
        return res

```
