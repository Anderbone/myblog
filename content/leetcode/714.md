[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.
**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 
**Example 1:**
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2 Output: 8 Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by: - Buying at prices[0] = 1 - Selling at prices[3] = 8 - Buying at prices[4] = 4 - Selling at prices[5] = 9 The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

                ans += prices[i] - fee - minimum
                minimum = prices[i] - fee #if next time a certain price even is lower than prices[i] - fee we sell it, we can get more
