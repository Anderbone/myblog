Given an integer n, return __an array __ans__ of length __n + 1__ such that for each __i__ __(0 <= i <= n)__, __ans[i]__ is the **number of **__1__**'s** in the binary representation of __i.
 
**Example 1:**
Input: n = 2 Output: [0,1,1] Explanation: 0 --> 0 1 --> 1 2 --> 10  
**Example 2:**
Input: n = 5 Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2] Explanation: 0 --> 0 1 --> 1 2 --> 10 3 --> 11 4 --> 100 5 --> 101

    return [bin(i).count('1') for i in range(num+1)]

class Solution:
    def countBits(self, num: int) -> List[int]:
        counter = [0]
        for i in range(1, num+1):
            counter.append(counter[i >> 1] + i % 2)
        return counter
```
To understand the solution, we remember the following two points from math:
All whole numbers can be represented by **2N** (__even__) and **2N+1** (__odd__).

For a given binary number, multiplying by 2 is the same as adding a zero at the end (just as we just add a zero when multiplying by ten in base 10).Since multiplying by 2 just adds a zero, then any number and its double will have the same number of 1’s. Likewise, doubling a number and adding one will increase the count by exactly 1. Or:

countBits(N) = countBits(2N)  
countBits(N)+1 = countBits(2N+1)Thus we can see that any number will have the same __bit count__ as half that number, with an extra one if it’s an odd number. We iterate through the range of numbers and calculate each bit count successively in this manner:
