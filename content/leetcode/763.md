You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.
Return __a list of integers representing the size of these parts__.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij" Output: [9,7,8] 

Explanation: The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij". This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part. A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts. 

Example 2:
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec" Output: [10]

For each char we meet, we check the rightmost position of the same char. cur_left and cur_right is the index of our current result, in between we check all chars that we haven't checked before, and update the rightmost position if nessary. After we check all chars between cur_left and cur_right, (cur_chars), we got one result and update the string by cutting our result off.

```py
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        cur_left = 0
        visited = set()
        
        while s:
            visited.add(s[0])
            cur_right = s.rfind(s[0])
            
            cur_chars = set(list(s[cur_left:cur_right+1]))
            while cur_chars:
                c = cur_chars.pop()
                if c not in visited:
                    visited.add(c)
                    new_right = s.rfind(c)
                    if new_right > cur_right:
                        cur_chars.update(set(list(s[cur_right+1:new_right+1])))
                        cur_right = new_right

            res.append(cur_right - cur_left + 1)
            s = s[cur_right+1:]
            
        return res
        
```
