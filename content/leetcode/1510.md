[Stone Game IV - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iv/)

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
Initially, there are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a __move__ consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.
Given a positive integer n, return true if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return false, assuming both players play optimally.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 1 Output: true Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
Example 2:
Input: n = 2 Output: false Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0). 
Example 3:
Input: n = 4 Output: true Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0). 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= n <= 105

Let's think in the backtrack way. If we have a state i that we know the current player must lose, what can we infer?
-- Any other states that can go to i must be True.
