+++
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return __the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**__.
 
**Example 1:**
Input: nums = [2,3,2] Output: 3 Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
**Example 2:**
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: 4 Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
