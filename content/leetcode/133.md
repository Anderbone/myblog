Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.
Return a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.
Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node { public int val; public List<Node> neighbors; }

- code
```py
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node): #DFS iteratively
        if not node:
            return node
        m = {node: Node(node.val)}
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            n = stack.pop()
            for neigh in n.neighbors:
                if neigh not in m:
                    stack.append(neigh)
                    m[neigh] = Node(neigh.val)
                m[n].neighbors.append(m[neigh])
        return m[node]
        

```
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node): # BFS 
        if not node:
            return node
        m = {node: Node(node.val)}
        deque = collections.deque([node])
        while deque:
            n = deque.popleft()
            for neigh in n.neighbors:
                if neigh not in m:
                    deque.append(neigh)
                    m[neigh] = Node(neigh.val)
                m[n].neighbors.append(m[neigh])
        return m[node]

```
- code
```py
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node): # DFS recursively
        if not node:
            return node
        m = {node: Node(node.val)}
        self.dfs(node, m)
        return m[node]
    
    def dfs(self, node, m):
        for neigh in node.neighbors:
            if neigh not in m:
                m[neigh] = Node(neigh.val)
                self.dfs(neigh, m)
            m[node].neighbors.append(m[neigh])
