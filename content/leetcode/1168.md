[Optimize Water Distribution in a Village - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/optimize-water-distribution-in-a-village/)
There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.
For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i - 1] (note the -1 due to 0-indexing), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes, where each pipes[j] = [house1j, house2j, costj] represents the cost to connect house1j and house2j together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.
Return __the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses__.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]] Output: 3 Explanation:  The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes. The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.

class Solution:
    def minCostToSupplyWater(self, n: int, wells: List[int], pipes: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        root = [i for i in range(n+1)]
        self.cost = 0
        
        def find(x):
            if x != root[x]:
                root[x] = find(root[x])
            return root[x]
        
        def union(x, y, cost):
            rtx = find(x)
            rty = find(y)
            if rtx == rty:
                return
            root[rtx] = rty
            self.cost += cost

        # virtual node 0, the cost to each node is the cost of that well, so we only consider edges
        for i, well in enumerate(wells):
            pipes.append([0, i+1, well])
            
        pipes.sort(key = lambda x: x[2])
        
        for x, y, cost in pipes:
            union(x, y, cost)
                        
        return self.cost
