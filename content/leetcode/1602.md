[Find Nearest Right Node in Binary Tree - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-nearest-right-node-in-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree and a node u in the tree, return __the nearest node on the same level that is to the right of__ u__, or return__ null __if __u __is the rightmost node in its level__.
 
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/24/p3.png)Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,5,6], u = 4 Output: 5 Explanation: The nearest node on the same level to the right of node 4 is node 5. 
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/23/p2.png)Input: root = [3,null,4,2], u = 2 Output: null Explanation: There are no nodes to the right of 2. 
 
Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].
	1 <= Node.val <= 105
	All values in the tree are distinct.
	u is a node in the binary tree rooted at root.

```py
class Solution:
    def findNearestRightNode(self, root: TreeNode, u: TreeNode) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        level = [root]
        while level:
            for i, cur in enumerate(level):
                if cur == u:
                    if i == len(level) - 1: return None
                    return level[i + 1]
            
            level = [i for node in level for i in (node.left, node.right) if i]
```
