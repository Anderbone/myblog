[Sudoku Solver - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/)

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

	Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
	Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
	Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.The '.' character indicates empty cells.
 
**Example 1:**

**Constraints:**

	board.length == 9
	board[i].length == 9
	board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
	It is **guaranteed** that the input board has only one solution.
