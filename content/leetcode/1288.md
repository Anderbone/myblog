[Remove Covered Intervals - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-covered-intervals/)

Given an array intervals where intervals[i] = [li, ri] represent the interval [li, ri), remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.
The interval [a, b) is covered by the interval [c, d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d.
Return __the number of remaining intervals__.
 
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]] Output: 2 Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed. 
Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]] Output: 1 
 
Constraints:

	1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
	intervals[i].length == 2
	0 <= li <= ri <= 105
	All the given intervals are unique.
