https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return __the researcher's h-index__.
According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
 
**Example 1:**
**Input:** citations = [3,0,6,1,5] **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3. 
**Example 2:**
**Input:** citations = [1,3,1] **Output:** 1 
 
**Constraints:**
 	
	n == citations.length 	
	1 <= n <= 5000 	
	0 <= citations[i] <= 1000

        int r = Arrays.stream(citations).max().getAsInt();
        while (l < r){
            int m = (l + r) / 2;
            if (hSuccess(citations, m)){
                l = m + 1;
            }else{
                r = m;
            }
        }
        if (hSuccess(citations, l)) return Math.min(l, citations.length);
        return Math.min(l-1, citations.length);

    public boolean hSuccess(int[] arr, int h){
        return Arrays.stream(arr).filter(i -> i >= h).count() >= h;
