tags = ["leetcode","binarytree"]
+++

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.
Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
Given the root of the binary tree, return __the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police__.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1] Output: 7 Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7. 
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob2-tree.jpg)Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1] Output: 9 Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

```py
class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def helper(node):
            if not node: return (0, 0)
            left_rob, left_not = helper(node.left)
            right_rob, right_not = helper(node.right)
            cur_rob = node.val + left_not + right_not
            cur_not = max(left_rob, left_not) + max(right_rob, right_not)
            return (cur_rob, cur_not)
        
        return max(helper(root))
```
