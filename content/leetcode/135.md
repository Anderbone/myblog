There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.Return __the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children__.
 
Example 1:
Input: ratings = [1,0,2] Output: 5 Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively. 

Example 2:
Input: ratings = [1,2,2] Output: 4 Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively. The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        candies = [1] * len(ratings)
        # left to right, make sure I'm bigger than left
        for i in range(1, len(ratings)):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1
        # right to left, I'm bigger than right
        for i in range(len(ratings)-2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i+1] + 1)
                
        return sum(candies)
