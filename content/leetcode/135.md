https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

	Each child must have at least one candy.
	Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.Return __the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children__.
 
Example 1:
Input: ratings = [1,0,2] Output: 5 Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively. 

Example 2:
Input: ratings = [1,2,2] Output: 4 Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively. The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
