Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”
 
**Example 1:**  
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8 Output: 6 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
**Example 2:**  
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

                root = root.right
            elif root.val > q.val:
                root = root.left
            # elif p.val < root.val < q.val or root.val == p.val or root.val == q.val:

            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        else:
            return root
