              <p>It&rsquo;s simply the best novel I have ever read. I agree with almost every place in the book where you can feel Dostoevsky’s strong point of view and laugh with joy.</p>
<p>I convinced my father, a few Christian and non-Christian friends to read it, and I&rsquo;m pleased few people already have it in their hands. I definitely will reread it.</p>
<p>I read it in Chinese, and for different English versions, I compared some reviews and bought <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Karamazov-Brothers-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199536376">Ignat Avsey&rsquo;s English translation</a>. It&rsquo;s in a friend&rsquo;s hands, I hope he will enjoy it.</p>

<p>“Be not forgetful of prayer. Every time you pray, if your prayer is sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning in it, which will give you fresh courage, and you will understand that prayer is an education.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The more I love humanity in general the less I love man in particular. In my dreams, I often make plans for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually face crucifixion if it were suddenly necessary. Yet I am incapable of living in the same room with anyone for two days together. I know from experience. As soon as anyone is near me, his personality disturbs me and restricts my freedom. In twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one because he’s too long over his dinner, another because he has a cold and keeps on blowing his nose. I become hostile to people the moment they come close to me. But it has always happened that the more I hate men individually the more I love humanity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is hell? I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Above all, do not lie to yourself. A man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point where he does not discern any truth either in himself or anywhere around him, and thus falls into disrespect towards himself and others. Not respecting anyone, he ceases to love, and having no love, he gives himself up to passions and coarse pleasures in order to occupy and amuse himself, and in his vices reaches complete beastiality, and it all comes form lying continually to others and himself. A man who lies to himself is often the first to take offense. it sometimes feels very good to take offense, doesn&rsquo;t it? And surely he knows that no one has offended him, and that he himself has invented the offense and told lies just for the beauty of it, that he has exaggerated for the sake of effect, that he has picked up on a word and made a mountain out of a pea&ndash;he knows all of that, and still he is the first to take offense, he likes feeling offended, it gives him great pleasure, and thus he reaches the point of real hostility&hellip;”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is only one way to salvation, and that is to make yourself responsible for all men&rsquo;s sins. As soon as you make yourself responsible in all sincerity for everything and for everyone, you will see at once that this is really so, and that you are in fact to blame for everyone and for all things.”</p>

<hr>
<p>The best moment for me is what happened to Alyosha after the death of his mentor Father Zosima. People expect some kind of miracles especially Alyosha himself, but what bitterly disappointed is only a few hours after his death, his body begins to rot and smell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was not just a question of miracles. It was by no means a case of frivolous expectation of the miraculous.  Alyosha needed miracles neither to confirm any particular convictions of his (that least of all) nor to bolster the triumph of any deep-seated, preconceived theory over other theories—not that either; in his case I was first and foremost a question of love and veneration of one individual person, that and nothing else—the person of his beloved starets, his mentor.  The point to bear in mind is that at that particular time and throughout the whole of the preceding year, all the love that he had borne in his pure young heart towards ‘all and sundry’ had appeared on occasion and particularly at times of spiritual crisis to be concentrated, however mistakenly, on one single individual, that is on his beloved starets, who was now dead.  In fact, this being had been an unquestionable paragon for him for so long that all his youthful energy and all his aspirations were channeled perforce towards that same paragon, on occasion even to the exclusion of ‘all and sundry.’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But again it was not miracles he needed; rather, some ‘supreme justice’ that he believed had been violated, and as a consequence of which violation his heart had been so cruelly and unexpectedly wounded.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that by the very nature of things Alyosha should expect this ‘justice’ to take the form of the instant miracle expected from the bodily remains of his beloved erstwhile teacher?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then had a dream and Zosima appeared in a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee, where Jesus changes water into wine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Filled with rapture, his soul yearned for freedom, space, vastness. Over him the heavenly dome, full of quiet, shining stars, hung boundlessly. From the zenith to the horizon the still-dim Milky Way stretched its double strand. Night, fresh and quiet, almost unstirring, enveloped the earth. The white towers and golden domes of the church gleamed in the sapphire sky. The luxuriant autumn flowers in the flowerbeds near the house had fallen asleep until morning. The silence of the earth seemed to merge with the silence of the heavens, the mystery of the earth touched the mystery of the stars&hellip; Alyosha stood gazing and suddenly, as if he had been cut down, threw himself to the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He did not know why he was embracing it, he did not try to understand why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss all of it, but he was kissing it, weeping, sobbing, and watering it with his tears, and he vowed ecstatically to love it, to love it unto ages of ages. &ldquo;Water the earth with the tears of your joy, and love those tears&hellip;,&rdquo; rang in his soul. What was he weeping for? Oh, in his rapture he wept even for the stars that shone on him from the abyss, and &ldquo;he was not ashamed of this ecstasy.&rdquo; It was as if threads from all those innumerable worlds of God all came together in his soul, and it was trembling all over, &ldquo;touching other worlds.&rdquo; He wanted to forgive everyone and for everything, and to ask forgiveness, oh, not for himself! but for all and for everything, &ldquo;as others are asking for me,&rdquo; rang again in his soul. But with each moment he felt clearly and almost tangibly something as firm and immovable as this heavenly vault descend into his soul. Some sort of idea, as it were, was coming to reign in his mind-now for the whole of his life and unto ages of ages. <strong>He fell to the earth a weak youth and rose up a fighter,</strong> steadfast for the rest of his life, and he knew it and felt it suddenly, in that very moment of his ecstasy. Never, never in all his life would Alyosha forget that moment. &ldquo;Someone visited my soul in that hour,&rdquo; he would say afterwards, with firm belief in his words&hellip;”</p>
