      <description>A week of work in the United Arab Emirates (Uae) was a week of chatting with Soho, a Pakistani driver. RAK (Ras Al Khaimah) where I live is different from Dubai, it is just a remote coastal town. Once independent in history, it decided to join the UAE in 1972.&#xA;The street is a 40-degree heat wave and dusty, broken cars and luxury cars side by side, Many shops are open at night but there are few pedestrians.</description>

      <description>The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena. Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages. And in fact both were right and both wrong; though the view of the ancients is clearer insofar as they have an acknowledged terminus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everything were explained.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s from a Chinese podcast Story FM 故事FM, Episode 664, they invite people to tell their own real-life stories. I have been given permission for translation and publication here.&#xA;Shenzhen is one of the largest cities in China, and most made-in-China electronics come from Shenzhen.&#xA;Original page (WeChat) contains many pictures at that time, this is a translated version.&#xA;In 1998, I graduated from junior high school and wanted to go out to work, but my mother wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me.</description>

      <title>Personality types don&#39;t exist,  life is not a matching game</title>

      <description>God did not create people with a predetermined type of introversion, extroversion or ABCD, unlike someone who is born with a sweet tooth and someone who likes salty, people have the freedom to choose understanding-based behaviour. The so-called most introverted person also desires friends, and the so-called most extroverted person enjoys solitude at some point. Personality types do not exist or do not exist outside of language. Even though people may exhibit personalities and characteristics, it needs to be interpreted in the concrete real world, not determined by internal mechanisms hypothesized by artificial concepts.</description>

      <title>Dangerous words, why psychology is impossible</title>

      <description>“But profound as psychology is, it&amp;rsquo;s a knife that cuts both ways (&amp;hellip;). I have purposely resorted to this method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you can prove anything by it. It all depends on who makes use of it. Psychology lures even most serious people into romancing, and quite unconsciously.” ― Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Brothers Karamazov&#xA;“The confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be explained by calling it a “young science”; its state is not comparable with that of physics, for instance, in its beginnings&amp;hellip; For in psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion&amp;hellip; The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems which trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by” (Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, 1968, II xiv, 232e).</description>

      <description>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. John 1:1 (ESV)&#xA;And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. Genesis 1:3 NIV&#xA;Therefore this is what the LORD says: “If you repent, I will restore you that you may serve me; if you utter worthy, not worthless, words, you will be my spokesman. Jeremiah 15:19 NIV&#xA;Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</description>

      <description>Dad shared such a little story recently.&#xA;The couple quarrelled, and the child ran around and found out: you two are not fighting again!&#xA;He ran to his dad, &amp;ldquo;Dad, dad, you just apologize to mom, you guys make up!&amp;rdquo; Dad sighed sadly and shook his head, &amp;ldquo;Your mom is not even talking to me right now.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The child rushed to mom&amp;rsquo;s side again, &amp;ldquo;Mom, mom, you make up with dad, dad is not coming to talk now, but I know his heart is weeping!</description>

      <title>The Karamazov Brothers is the best novel I have ever read</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s simply the best novel I have ever read. I agree with almost every place in the book where you can feel Dostoevsky’s strong point of view and laugh with joy.&#xA;I convinced my father, a few Christian and non-Christian friends to read it, and I&amp;rsquo;m pleased few people already have it in their hands. I definitely will reread it.&#xA;I read it in Chinese, and for different English versions, I compared some reviews and bought Ignat Avsey&amp;rsquo;s English translation.</description>

      <description>When I was in university in China, for a while I was not busy, and interested in dreams. In my lucid dreams, I knew I was in a dream, I could have keys in my hands by just thinking of keys, and the feeling of keys in my dream was the same as in reality. I felt there’s something beyond this material world, and couldn’t stop reading the next book, new age, Buddhism, psychology, etc.</description>

      <description>During the Cultural Revolution, communists were supposed to eliminate all religious and old cultures, including Confucious, Christianity, Buddism, and Muslim as well.&#xA;The communist army put pigs&amp;rsquo; heads in the Muslim community&amp;rsquo;s well. The tension kept growing, the Muslim elite from Shadian went to Beijing to talk about the situation with communist leaders, and when they came back they knew the situation was going to be worse. Obviously, they felt what was going to happen, one of the elites begged their Muslim people to send women and children out, but people were so angry and refused and thought he has betrayed them.</description>

      <description>Self-esteem, self-love, self-help, self-respect, self, self, self.&#xA;You can&amp;rsquo;t love others properly without loving yourself at first. - popular idea&#xA;We love because He first loved us. 1 John 4: 19&#xA;Mental states do not come before language nor accompany a sequence of words but are lived and experienced in the context of linguistic expression. -Wittgenstein&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s wrong from a syntax perspective at first. Help, love, respect, and care, when we use these words, they are usually correctly used to describe the relationship between people.</description>

      <description>The craving for generality is a philosophical sin.&#xA;Everyone is born with some difference. Features like hair colour, and sports/music gifts, likes salt/sweet, exist and don&amp;rsquo;t change much according to context, they are self-determined.&#xA;Obviously, there are people who are generally more talkative, and friendly to strangers and people who probably don&amp;rsquo;t talk much. Nobody denies that. By observing these things in real life, we created the concept of introvert and extrovert.</description>

      <description>Regarding the height of the seat and the height of the screen, I won’t talk about it. Everyone understands it and it’s easy to adjust it.&#xA;I will focus on a very critical point here, and the majority don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do it properly, which is the height position of the arm and wrist when using the keyboard and mouse.&#xA;Generally speaking, most people, including me, put their arms on the table and their wrists on the table or hand rest.</description>

      <description>The Great Chinese famine from 1959 to 1961 in China killed 15 to 55 million people.&#xA;In those years, many intellectuals were sent to a re-education labour camp in Jiabiangou, Gansu province. People ate everything they could and couldn&amp;rsquo;t eat, some couldn&amp;rsquo;t even go outside to defecate, and could only pull it on their frozen bed. Tree bark was eaten up and some people ate human corpses. Some people were deliberately buried very shallow, so they were easily dug out to be eaten at night.</description>

      <description>Appreciate Peter&amp;rsquo;s help.&#xA;The ignoble are the wisest, the noble are the stupidest. These sayings are the essence of Mao Zedong&amp;rsquo;s thought, for the majority of Chinese to live by, the formation of the present China.&#xA;Basically, the evolution of the Zhuxia(Huaxia, Chinese) civilization is a deteriorating change: from the Spring and Autumn, the Warring States to the Qin and Han dynasties, and then through the Wei, Jin, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, we can clearly see a trend: the backbone of society such as nobles, clans, etc.</description>
