      <description>The Great Chinese famine from 1959 to 1961 in China killed 15 to 55 million people.&#xA;In those years, many intellectuals were sent to a re-education labour camp in Jiabiangou, Gansu province. People ate everything they could and couldn&amp;rsquo;t eat, some couldn&amp;rsquo;t even go outside to defecate, and could only pull it on their frozen bed. Tree bark was eaten up and some people ate human corpses. Some people were deliberately buried very shallow, so they were easily dug out to be eaten at night.</description>
