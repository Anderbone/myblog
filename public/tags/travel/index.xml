      <description>A week of work in the United Arab Emirates (Uae) was a week of chatting with Soho, a Pakistani driver. RAK (Ras Al Khaimah) where I live is different from Dubai, it is just a remote coastal town. Once independent in history, it decided to join the UAE in 1972.&#xA;The street is a 40-degree heat wave and dusty, broken cars and luxury cars side by side, Many shops are open at night but there are few pedestrians.</description>
