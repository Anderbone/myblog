      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s simply the best novel I have ever read. I agree with almost every place in the book where you can feel Dostoevskyâ€™s strong point of view and laugh with joy.&#xA;I convinced my father, a few Christian and non-Christian friends to read it, and I&amp;rsquo;m pleased few people already have it in their hands. I definitely will reread it.&#xA;I read it in Chinese, and for different English versions, I compared some reviews and bought Ignat Avsey&amp;rsquo;s English translation.</description>
